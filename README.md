# Demonstration of Artifical Intelligence Use Cases using Red Hat products

This repo has been created in order to showcase the usage of Red Hat products for developing and running Artifical Intelligence (AI) workloads.

## [Demo 01 - Licence plate recognition](demos/01_license_plate/README.md)

The first demo of this series is based on the "Red Hat OpenShift Data Science Workshop - Licence plate recognition"[^license_plate_desc] and shows the usage of Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces (CRW) running on Red Hat Openshift to create a develeopment environment for an Artifical Intelligence (AI) workload, which can be executed from within CRW using CPU and GPU. More details can be found [here](demos/01_license_plate/README.md).
