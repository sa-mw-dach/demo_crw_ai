# Demonstration of Software Development, DevOps and Cloud-Native Use Cases using Red Hat products

This repo has been created in order to showcase the usage of Red Hat products for Software Development, DevOps and Cloud-Native.

## [Demo 01 - Licence plate recognition](demos/01_license_plate/README.md)

The first demo of this series is based on the "Red Hat OpenShift Data Science Workshop - Licence plate recognition"[^license_plate_desc] and shows the usage of Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces (CRW) running on Red Hat Openshift to create a development environment for an Artifical Intelligence (AI) workload, which can be executed from within CRW using CPU and GPU. More details can be found [here](demos/01_license_plate/README.md).

## [Demo 02 - Dev Spaces Devfiles](demos/02_devfiles/README.md)

This part contains some devfiles for testing Dev Spaces functionality.
